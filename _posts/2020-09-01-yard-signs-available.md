It is only 65 days until the election and we have been busy delivering yard signs and sending fundraising emails.  If you need a yard sign, just send me an email at erinlunceford@gmail.com, or a Facebook private message.  Because Texas no longer has straight ticket voting, I am going to need all my supporters to send emails to all their friends and neighbors, telling them how important it is to vote down ballot for the judges.  I am the first District Court race that is contested on your Harris County ballot.  I will be sure to post a sample ballot page as soon as they are released.  There is still time to donate to my campaign if you are interested, but I really need all your votes.  Early voting starts on Tuesday, October 13th, so you will have almost 3 weeks to vote early.  Remember, vote Erin Elizabeth Lunceford for Judge of the 61st District Court.  I am the most experienced and best qualified in this race!
